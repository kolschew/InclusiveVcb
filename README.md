# InclusiveVcb
Code with the theory prediction for Vcb from q2 normalized and centralized moments.

## Installation
To install the package run
```
pip3 install -e .
```
in your `python3` environment of choice. The `-e` option allows you to continuously edit the code while the changes are directly adopted in the package. The `setuptools` package is necessary for the install. If it is missing please install it with
```
pip3 install setuptools
```
It is advisable to setup a new virtual environment and install the project and its dependencies there. An introduction on how to setup such a virtual environment can be found [here](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/).

To install package and development dependencies, run
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
This installs all the dependencies needed for the package.
